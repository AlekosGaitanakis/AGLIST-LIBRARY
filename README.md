AGLIST LIBRARY is a Single-Linked-List-Library
And the most important thing is that the Sort of the list is in O(n) time, but to do that, the insert at the start is with O(logn) time, 
because of the insertion to the avl tree.

Note: to do the sort for the list in O(n) time, the insertions must be done with the insertions of the aglist library, because we use the avl trees to help us.
In the library it is also a insert_at_sorted_list function that insert in sorted list.
